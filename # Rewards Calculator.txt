# Rewards Calculator 

This is a React application that calculates reward points for customers based on their transaction history.

## Project Description

In this project, a customer's reward points are calculated based on each recorded purchase. They receive:

- 2 points for every dollar spent over $100 in each transaction
- 1 point for every dollar spent between $50 and $100 in each transaction

This project also includes a simulation of fetching transaction data from an API, and the calculation of the reward points per transaction, which are then accumulated per month and in total for each customer.
